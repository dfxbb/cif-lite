* TODO: Extend the CIF Lite query for further types of queries, such as those against "cif_recent_additions"

* TODO: Extend the CIF Lite query to the RESTful API or wrapper around the existing CIF client tool to be able 
to query against the CIF Lite database schema.  (Look into FF plugin, also, maybe a simple query web UI)

* TODO: Update the CIF Lite query to store searches

* TODO: Build a CIF Lite feeds script, use the table "cif_recent_additions" for quickly identifying
what is new to make appends into your blocklists.
  -- Inclusion of whitelisting, etc. for feed building
  -- After 48hrs expire entries from cif_recent_additions table

* TODO: Build a "conversion" script to migrate data that is already in CIF into CIF Lite

* TODO: Wrapper around cif_analytics for CIF Lite?

* TODO: Wes just pushed out CIF v1 Beta2 ... I haven't looked at this code yet to see if CIF Lite
can be integrated the same way as I did in v0.01.
