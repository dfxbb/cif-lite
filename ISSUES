* ISSUE: I'm seeing that the cif_lite_data table is growing very quickly with a variety of data (IPs, netblocks, domains, URLs, MD5, SHA1)
I'm thinking that it may be best to store each type in its own table for faster searching ... also allows better capability with things
like IP or Netblock (e.g., store IP in integer format).

* TODO: Extend the CIF Lite query for further types of queries, such as those against "cif_recent_additions"

* TODO: Extend the CIF Lite query to the RESTful API or wrapper around the existing CIF client tool to be able 
to query against the CIF Lite database schema.  (Look into FF plugin, also, maybe a simple query web UI)

* TODO: Update the CIF Lite query to store searches

* TODO: Build a CIF Lite feeds script, use the table "cif_recent_additions" for quickly identifying
what is new to make appends into your blocklists.
  -- Inclusion of whitelisting, etc. for feed building
  -- After 48hrs expire entries from cif_recent_additions table

* TODO: Build a "conversion" script to migrate data that is already in CIF into CIF Lite

* TODO: Wrapper around cif_analytics for CIF Lite?

* LIMITATION ISSUE: Linkages within the data entries are not preserved, e.g., 
a datafeed that has three fields url,md5,sha1 -- each field would be stored separately as a "value"
in the CIF Lite database without there being a relationship among them.
This linkage isn't currently needed from the perspective of automating the process
of generating blocklists and just storage/retrieval of indicators.  But the linkage information
is important to have when going back and conducting analysis on a specific incident/event.

* TODO: Wes just pushed out CIF v1 Beta2 ... I haven't looked at this code yet to see if CIF Lite
can be integrated the same way as I did in v0.01.
